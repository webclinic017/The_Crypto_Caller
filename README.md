## **Project Description**

We want to create a dashboard that utilizes ML models, with a user input of their crypto portfolio and create a diversified portfolio to attempt to beat the returns on their current crypto wallet. The hope is that we are able to match if not do better than the returns of the original portfolio over a specified risk spectrum selected by the user. In doing so, we want to present this in a way that is palatable to the user via a dashboard that will allow the user to input their wallet, select their risk aversion, and allow the ML model to create a diversified portfolio utilizing their assets to potentially provide an increase in return.

Our dashboard will provide you an opportunity to make choices to create a better return with your current crypto wallet, utilizing Algorithms and Machine Learning to optimize and diversify their current crypto wallet. The dashboard will suggest next steps to make a potential change for a greater overall return to compare to their original wallet. We hope to beat their current wallet with a higher return.
